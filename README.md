# TERTIS-Game-in-C

This project is an implementation of the famous TETRIS game which was published by Nintendo in 1989.

This game is designed under Free Real Time Operating System (FreeRTOS).

The game could be flashed to a STM32F429 Discovery kit manufactured by ST Electronics.

The game could be played in both Single-Player and Double-Player mode. However, in order to enable the Double-Player mode,
a UART cable must be used to connect two boards.

To find the game files, please go to "TETRIS/code/"

Claim: Except for the "code" folder, other files are the FreeRTOS open source files which could be downloaded at:
